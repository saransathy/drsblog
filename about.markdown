Myself, commonly called as **DRS** which stands for **Devendran Ranganayaki Saravanan**. As per Government Records I go by **Saravanan Devendran** where **Devendran** is my Father's firstname. The part of the country I live in typically Father's firstname becomes Lastname for the children. Inspired by my School Physics Teachers name, where she put her mother's name also part of her initials to give equal respect, I included my mother's firstname as part of my name from that age. Hence call myself as **DRS**.

For the past couple of years I have been writing blogs but not in a regular fashion.
I am not a great writer at the sametime continuously improving my writing capabilities which would help me to
communicate better my experiences and share knowledge.

You can visit the blogs I published in LinkedIn by clicking the titles here:

1. [Cognitive and Automation](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cognitive-automation-saravanan-devendran/)
2. [I am in Cognitive](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-am-cognitive-saravanan-devendran/)
3. [Technology Update - IBM HMC](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/technology-update-ibm-hmc-saravanan-devendran/)
